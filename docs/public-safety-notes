# Public safety notes

This repository intentionally omits:
- internal IP addresses and hostnames beyond high-level node names
- secrets/tokens/passwords
- exact storage paths and mounts
- detailed firewall/router configuration
- any externally reachable endpoints

Diagrams show architecture and flows, not a network blueprint.
